> What [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) should've been.

### ðŸš§ This is a proof of concept and isn't fully functional yet. ðŸš§

Most CI/CD tools are too opinionated and do too much. Bob follows the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well, and the emacs philosophy of extensibility, and strives for [simpler, decomposed and hence more composable and unbundled design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg). For more information, see [Why Bob](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/why-bob.html)

## Getting Started 
To build and run your pipelines, you just need to do a `docker-compose up` and make a few HTTP requests. Check out the [Getting Started](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/getting-started.html) guide.


## Internals

Bob's API (accessible entirely through HTTP) enables a core set of CI/CD features. The following are the only concepts that Bob is opinionated about:
  - Steps: Direct commands (like a shell command, `pytest`, etc)
  - Pipeline: Ordered series of steps
  - Environment: Key-Value store associated with either Steps and/or Pipelines
  - Resources: Things (like source code or artifacts) consumed by Pipelines
  - Artifacts: Something produced by a Pipeline


The core of Bob is composed of 3 main services:
- [API server](/apiserver)
- [Entities](/entities)
- [Runner](/runner)

All of these services live, breathe, and deploy from their own section of this mono-repo. Post-deployment, they are coordinated via a central persistent queue. Read more about Bob's [Architecture](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/architecture.html).



## Join the conversation
Please start a [discussion](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/discussions) on literally any topic and we are happy to help and learn from each other! You can check out the Kanban [board](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/projects/1) to see the roadmap and planned work.

For a more Clojure specific discussion there we also have a Clojurians Slack [channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/CPBAYJJF6).

Happy Building!
