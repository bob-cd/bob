  "Creates a new pipeline.

  Takes the following:
  - group
  - name
  - a list of steps
  - a map of environment vars
  - a map of artifacts
  - a list of resources
  - a starting Docker image.

  The group defines a logical grouping of pipelines like dev or staging
  and the name is the name of the pipeline like build or test.
  Steps is a list of strings of the commands that need to be executed in sequence.
  The steps are assumed to be valid shell commands.

  Returns Ok or the error if any."
